#lang typed/racket

;; basic delay and force implementations for typed/racket based on lambda + box
;; used in okasaki data structure implementations
(provide Promiseof delay force)

;; - Outer box is for memoization
;; - Inner box is so TR can distinguished a forced promise from an unforced one
;;     I would have used a struct like Prom instead of the inner box, but TR
;;     cannnot distinguish structs from procedures?
